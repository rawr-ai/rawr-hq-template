# Agent E Plan - OpenAPI + Docs (S06/S09)

## Objective

Deliver day-1 OpenAPI exposure and finalize docs/runbooks/skills to ORPC root-router default.

## Scope

1. Ensure OpenAPI endpoints/spec are exposed and usable.
2. Add usage conventions for RPC-first, OpenAPI-available.
3. Update system/process/runbook docs and relevant skills.

## Constraints

- Keep docs aligned with exception policy for non-procedure routes.
- Reflect latest top-stack changes while editing docs.
