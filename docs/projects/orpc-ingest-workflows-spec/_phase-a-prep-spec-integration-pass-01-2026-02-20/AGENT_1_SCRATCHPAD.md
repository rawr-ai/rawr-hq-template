# Agent 1 Scratchpad

## 2026-02-20T19:35:07Z
- Initialized scratchpad.
- Plan file written per mandatory protocol order.
- Next: introspect required skills before substantive packet edits.
[2026-02-20T19:35:52Z] Resumed execution in target worktree; verified branch and artifact root contents. Beginning mandatory skill introspection before substantive packet edits.
[2026-02-20T19:36:09Z] Scratchpad timestamp correction: continuing with concrete UTC timestamps for subsequent entries.
[2026-02-20T19:36:44Z] Completed mandatory skill introspection for 10 required skills. Key guidance captured: info-design (axis-driven doc shape, signal/noise), solution-design (frame + reversibility), system-design (explicit invariants/second-order effects), domain-design (single authority, seams), api-design (consumer-model + explicit contract), team-design (single accountability + coordination overhead), oRPC (contract-first and dual transport), Inngest (durable step semantics), rawr-hq-orientation (template vs instance roles + command-surface separation), docs-architecture (canonical docs minimality and placement discipline).
[2026-02-20T19:37:35Z] Read packet authorities and relevant axes: ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS, README, CANONICAL_EXPANSION_NAV, axis-10/11/12. Preparing minimal canonical updates + new axis-13 to lock distribution default and defer packaging mechanics centrally.
[2026-02-20T19:39:40Z] Applied doc edits: added axis-13 (distribution + instance lifecycle model), added D-016 lock to DECISIONS, and minimally updated ARCHITECTURE/README/CANONICAL_EXPANSION_NAV for canonical routing and coherence. Starting no-drift validation and evidence-line capture.
[2026-02-20T19:41:27Z] Wrote final report artifact with required sections (skills introspected, evidence map with absolute line anchors, assumptions, risks, unresolved questions, and changed-files rationale).
[2026-02-20T19:43:18Z] Reformatted final report for flat-list structure and validated absolute path evidence anchors.
[2026-02-20T19:50:31Z] Agent 2 fix-cycle started. Confirmed normative mismatch: D-016 seam-testing is MUST in DECISIONS but SHOULD in axis-13. Patched axis-13 D-015 blast-radius implications to MUST for alias/instance seam assertions and no-singleton negative assertions.
[2026-02-20T19:50:31Z] Patched IMPLEMENTATION_ADJACENT_DOC_UPDATES_SPEC with minimally scoped D-016 downstream execution obligations (policy/seam only): added D-016 compatibility baseline, D-016 addendum, lifecycle/runbook/harness/report validation requirements for seam assertions, and explicit guard against deferred UX/packaging mechanics.
[2026-02-20T19:51:14Z] Updated AGENT_1_FINAL_SPEC_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md with a dedicated fix-cycle section, added fix-cycle evidence anchors (axis-13 MUST lines and implementation-adjacent D-016 seam-contract propagation lines), and updated changed-files rationale.
[2026-02-20T19:51:42Z] Fix-cycle verification complete: axis-13 normative terms now align with D-016 lock (MUST), and implementation-adjacent downstream execution contract now includes D-016 seam obligations without deferred implementation mechanics.
