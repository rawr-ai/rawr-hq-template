# SESSION_019c587a Agent B Plan (Verbatim)

## Mission
- Produce the strongest coherent alternative to "packages are pure domain logic only."
- Define a boundary/runtime-centric package ownership model with explicit contract/runtime integration primitives.
- Pressure test the model against current proposal docs, transcript evidence, and today-state code.

## Required Deliverables
1. Live research scratchpad with explicit breadcrumbs:
   - `docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_AGENT_B_SCRATCHPAD.md`
2. Final Agent B architecture doc:
   - `docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_PACKAGE_APPROACH_B_BOUNDARY_OR_RUNTIME_CENTRIC_E2E.md`

## Process Constraints I Will Enforce
- Work only in this worktree:
  - `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal`
- Do not touch/revert unrelated edits.
- Use explicit `Observed` vs `Inferred` claims with file references while researching.
- Read and log all mandated skills/process/evidence sources before final recommendation.

## Working Method
1. Verify environment and branch state in the target worktree.
2. Initialize scratchpad and start a breadcrumb ledger (`Observed` vs `Inferred` + file refs).
3. Perform mandated skill/process introspection and log concise takeaways.
4. Read transcript + current proposal packet + today-state code and extract evidence.
5. Build Approach B model:
   - Contract ownership across package/api/workflow
   - API + workflow + composition + host mounting flow
   - Shared consumer strategy (web/cli/tests) + drift controls
   - Simpler vs harder tradeoff matrix
   - Migration path from today-state
6. Draft final end-to-end doc with concrete file tree + code illustrations.
7. Self-check final doc against all required sections and claim labeling.
8. Await Agent A path for cross-critique phase; then add `Counter-Review of Approach A` section and adjust recommendation if needed.

## Exit Criteria
- Final doc exists and includes every required section from the task prompt.
- Claims in the final doc are clearly labeled as `Observed` or `Inferred` where appropriate.
- Scratchpad captures research breadcrumbs and decision trail.
