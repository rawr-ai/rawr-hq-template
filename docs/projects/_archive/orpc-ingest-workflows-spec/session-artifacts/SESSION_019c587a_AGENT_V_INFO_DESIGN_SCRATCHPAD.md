Scratchpad:

- Confirmed instructions from information-design skill (axes, mandate, invariants) to guide review.
- Reviewed canonical packet folder and role metadata (core, decisions, axis annexes, canonical read path).
- Affimed integration changelog + file role matrix, confirming artifact list and responsibilities.
- Confirmed posture spec + context/converged direction align with canonical entrypoint/layer separation.
- Gate 1 (canonical entrypoint) confirmed via ORPC+Inngest spec entrypoint statements and canonical read path.
- Gate 2 (role metadata) satisfied in ORPC core, canonical read path, decisions ledger, canonical role contract, axis annexes, posture reference, reference examples, and redistribution traceability.
- Gate 3/4 (single-source invariants + annex pointing to core) satisfied: axis docs reference ORPC spec for global policy; examples/backref guardrails declare canonical owners.
- Gate 5 (examples reference-fenced) satisfied by normative boundary sections and canonical owner tables in each E2E example.
- Gate 6 (no absolute path) satisfied: canonical docs under `docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/orpc-ingest-spec-packet` and posture spec contain no `/Users/` anchors; absolute references remain only in historical artifacts and additive extraction records.
- Gate 7 (policy vs illustration clarity) satisfied by `CANONICAL_ROLE_CONTRACT.md` taxonomy and reference/annex metadata/normative boundary statements.
- Gate 8 (no architecture drift) satisfied by integration changelog and decisions doc confirming D-005..D-010 statuses and stating no runtime changes.
