# Agent F Plan - Final Cleanup (S08)

## Objective

Remove every temporary bridge, shim, and manual procedure path introduced or retained for transition.

## Scope

1. Delete manual procedure routes superseded by ORPC.
2. Delete temporary adapters and compatibility layers.
3. Verify no first-party direct fetch calls remain for replaced procedure APIs.

## Constraints

- Treat this as no-legacy gate.
- Deliver explicit proof checklist in scratch.
