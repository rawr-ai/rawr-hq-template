# Agent 5 Plan Verbatim

1. Introspect required TypeScript, oRPC, solution-design, system-design, and API-design guidance.
2. Read canonical Phase D packet and decisions plus D1-D4 runtime diffs.
3. Produce severity-ranked review findings with line-anchored evidence and concrete fixes.
4. Re-review after fixes and issue final disposition.
