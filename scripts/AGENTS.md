# Scripts

- Repo automation (including opt-in git hooks).
- Keep scripts deterministic and fast (they run in developer loops like hooks).
- Prefer `bun run …` entrypoints over hardcoded paths when possible.

## Next
- `githooks/AGENTS.md` — shipped hooks + enabling instructions
- `githooks/pre-commit` — runs staged-only security checks
- `../docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` — what the hooks are enforcing
