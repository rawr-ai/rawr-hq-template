# Agent 2 Research Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm operating context in the assigned worktree and enumerate all markdown docs under the packet root.
2. Initialize and continuously append a timestamped scratchpad with actions, evidence capture, interim judgments, and open questions.
3. Read every packet doc in scope end-to-end, including all required core docs and all `axes/*.md` files.
4. Run an information-design `/info:assess` style diagnosis across the packet:
   - audience/task/navigation assumptions
   - hierarchy quality and information scent
   - reference vs explanation mode clarity
   - axis coherence and intro framing strength
5. Evaluate discoverability and cognitive load of canonical policy presentation, with focus on long policy lists.
6. Use Axis 12 as benchmark style signal and test which of its structural patterns should generalize to other axes.
7. Produce severity-ranked findings (with confidence) and mark each recommendation as Mandatory or Optional.
8. Produce cross-packet navigation findings and a reusable axis opening/template pattern that scales across all axes.
9. Produce a minimal-change rewrite strategy prioritizing highest leverage, lowest churn edits.
10. Write final report with required sections and an evidence map using absolute paths plus line anchors.
