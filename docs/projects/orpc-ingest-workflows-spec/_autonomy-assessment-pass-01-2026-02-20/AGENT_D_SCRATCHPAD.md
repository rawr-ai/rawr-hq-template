[2026-02-20 13:40:19 EST] Initialized Agent D scratchpad after writing the verbatim plan. Next: gather repo/worktree status and begin required skill introspection.

[2026-02-20 13:40:44 EST] Required skill introspection complete (solution-design, system-design, domain-design, team-design). Captured governing heuristics: reframing/incentive tests, boundary choice, single-owner authority, interaction-over-roster team contracts, and second-order effects analysis.
[2026-02-20 13:42:15 EST] Completed primary document evidence pass across ARCHITECTURE + axes 03/07/08/11 + SYSTEM/AGENTS_SPLIT/PLUGINS + workspace plugin utilities. Initial tension observed: spec contract is manifest-first with plugin-owned API/workflow boundaries and rawr.kind/rawr.capability runtime keys, but current workspace plugin utility still keys behavior to legacy metadata fields (templateRole/channel/publishTier) and scans only cli/agents/web roots.
[2026-02-20 13:43:07 EST] Confirmed packages/hq workspace plugin utility and plugins/cli/plugins workspace utility are byte-identical (duplicate authority surface). Drafting final assessment: highlight domain ownership contract vs implementation drift (legacy metadata fields + limited plugin root coverage).
[2026-02-20 13:44:33 EST] Final assessment document written (AGENT_D_FINAL_DOMAIN_AUTHORITY_ASSESSMENT.md). Verification pass: only assigned artifact-root outputs were modified by this run.
