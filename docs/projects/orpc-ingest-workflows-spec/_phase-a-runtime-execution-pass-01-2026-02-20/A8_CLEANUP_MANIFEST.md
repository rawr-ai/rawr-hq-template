# A8 Cleanup Manifest

Date: 2026-02-21
Branch: `codex/phase-a-a8-docs-cleanup`
Worktree: `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/worktrees/wt-agent-codex-phase-a-runtime-implementation`

## Purpose
Capture the A8 cleanup action that removed superseded planning/scratch artifacts after Phase A docs alignment.

## A8 Actions (Historical)
1. Removed superseded `*_PLAN_VERBATIM.md` and `*_SCRATCHPAD.md` artifacts from the Phase A pass root.
2. Removed intermediate non-final review drafts superseded by final review disposition.
3. Kept canonical closure artifacts required to finish the phase:
   - `A7_REVIEW_DISPOSITION.md`
   - `A8_CLEANUP_MANIFEST.md`

## Current State Note
A later grounding/prep cleanup further reduced packet noise and removed remaining agent-level report files that had already been integrated into final handoff artifacts. Current forward-facing cleanup source:
- `docs/projects/orpc-ingest-workflows-spec/GROUNDING_WORKSPACE_PREP_CLEANUP.md`

## Rationale
A8 focused on preserving phase closure traceability while eliminating high-noise intermediate artifacts. Subsequent cleanup tightened this further for Phase B readiness.
