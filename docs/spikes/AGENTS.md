- Investigations/exploration (may end in “parked”, “do next”, or “turn into a plan”).
- Keep outcomes explicit: what we learned + what we decided + next step.

## Next
- `SPIKE_LLM_RISK_JUDGE.md` — parked; do not implement until explicitly un-parked
- `../PLAN.md` — architecture + execution runbook (canonical)
