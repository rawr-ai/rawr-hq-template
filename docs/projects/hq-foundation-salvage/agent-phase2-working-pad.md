# Agent Phase 2 Working Pad

## Live Decisions / Notes
- Initialized scratch docs before any code/content porting (required gate).
- Existing unrelated dirty files detected and intentionally left untouched:
  - `docs/projects/hq-foundation-salvage/PLAN_SCRATCH.md`
  - `docs/projects/hq-foundation-salvage/WORKING_PAD.md`
- Slice A decision: template guard manifest now uses explicit shared package paths to keep `packages/dev/**` personal-owned.
- Slice A decision: ownership docs now treat `plugins/agents/hq/**` as full template-managed HQ domain.
