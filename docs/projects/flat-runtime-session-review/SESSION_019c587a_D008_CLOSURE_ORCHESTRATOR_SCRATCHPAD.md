# SESSION_019c587a D008 Closure Orchestrator Scratchpad

## Objective
Execute D-008-first closure through Step 3 only (resolver -> integration -> steward), then stop before implementation planning.

## Hard Constraints
- Canonical docs remain canonical (no transient/state-tracking language).
- Preserve D-005/D-006/D-007 semantics.
- Docs-only pass.
- Coordination canvas remains optional context only.

## Roster
- Resolver Agent: pending
- Integration Agent: pending
- Steward Agent: pending

## Notes
- D-008 primary; D-009/D-010 non-blocking/minimal unless proven hard blockers.
