# Final Phase A Planning Summary

## Outcome
Phase A planning run completed with independent review and re-review closure. Final disposition is `approve`.

## What This Package Now Guarantees
1. Phase A is fully decision-complete and implementer-ready.
2. Runtime identity and route-family convergence are in-scope with no ambiguity.
3. Ownership is concretely bound with primary handles, backups, and decision SLAs.
4. Deferred items are centralized in one canonical deferred register.
5. Seven-day zero-read exit criterion has a concrete measurement contract.
6. Forward-only posture is preserved (no rollback-heavy planning artifacts).

## Final Artifact Set
1. `ORCHESTRATOR_PLAN_VERBATIM.md`
2. `ORCHESTRATOR_SCRATCHPAD.md`
3. `PHASE_A_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
4. `PHASE_A_WORKBREAKDOWN.yaml`
5. `PHASE_A_INTERFACE_DELTAS.md`
6. `PHASE_A_ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md`
7. `PHASE_SEQUENCE_RECONCILIATION.md`
8. `REVIEW_DISPOSITION.md`
9. `FINAL_PHASE_A_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md`

## Review Closure Record
- Initial review: `approve_with_changes`
- Fix cycle: completed by Agent 1 on integrated docs.
- Re-review: `approve` by Agent 4.

## Forward-Only Execution Reminder
1. Compatibility bridge is time-boxed.
2. Gate failures require remediation, not rollback choreography.
3. Deferred D-016 UX/packaging mechanics remain outside Phase A.
