# FUTURE: RAWR marketplace / library

This is a parked concept. **Not in scope for v1.**

High-level idea (later): a library of reusable RAWR plugins and script bundles that can be composed into a local RAWR HQ.

For v1, RAWR is explicitly **local-first** and optimized for agents building their own commands/plugins in-repo.
