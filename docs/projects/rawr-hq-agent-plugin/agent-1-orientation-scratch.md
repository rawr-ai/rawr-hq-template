## Verified facts

- RAWR HQ is personal downstream; RAWR HQ-Template is upstream baseline.
- Routing and ownership boundaries are explicitly documented.
- Plugin channels are hard split and should not be mixed.
- Micro-frontend contract and plugin runtime model are implemented and documented.

## Unsure/needs re-verify

- MCP-style permissions are planning direction vs implemented contract in current baseline.

## Open questions captured

- How much orientation content should include downstream sync mechanics by default.

## Output contributed

- Orientation skill structure and reference file breakdown.
