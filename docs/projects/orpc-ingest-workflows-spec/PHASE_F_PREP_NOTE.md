# Phase F Prep Note (Grounding + Readiness)

## Snapshot
1. Phase A through Phase E closures are landed on `main`.
2. Phase E closure artifacts include readiness, execution report, and final handoff.
3. Phase F starts from a clean stack/worktree baseline.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Publish a decision-complete Phase F planning packet.
2. Preserve locked invariants from prior phases.
3. Execute Phase F as one continuous forward-only wave through closure.

## Guardrails
1. Graphite-first stack operations with `gt sync --no-restack`.
2. Per-slice branch tracking before submit.
3. Mandatory independent review, structural assessment, docs cleanup, and readiness closure.
