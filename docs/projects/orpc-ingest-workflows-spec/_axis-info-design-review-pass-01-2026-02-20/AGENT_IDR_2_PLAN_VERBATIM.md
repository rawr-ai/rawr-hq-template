# Agent IDR-2 Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm operating context (worktree/branch) and initialize pass artifacts in the assigned pass root only.
2. Create and maintain a continuously updated timestamped scratchpad documenting actions, observations, decisions, and open questions.
3. Introspect required skills before substantive analysis:
   - information-design
   - solution-design
   - system-design
   - domain-design
   - api-design
   - docs-architecture
4. Read the full required packet (all listed core docs, all axis docs, all example docs) without skipping files.
5. Build an evidence map tying claims to concrete source locations and extract cross-axis structural patterns.
6. Run independent challenge review focused on:
   - whole-packet axis understandability
   - digestibility of long policy lists
   - intro framing strength per axis
   - whether Axis 12 pattern artifacts should be generalized across axes
7. Classify findings by severity and confidence, and label each as Keep As-Is vs Rewrite Now.
8. Produce cross-axis coherence checks (intro consistency, navigation consistency, policy/scenario separation).
9. Produce a prioritized Top 5 rewrite queue of highest-leverage information-design changes.
10. Write final report with required sections: Skills Introspected, Evidence Map, Assumptions, Risks, Unresolved Questions.
11. Validate that only assigned artifact files were touched, then finalize handoff.
