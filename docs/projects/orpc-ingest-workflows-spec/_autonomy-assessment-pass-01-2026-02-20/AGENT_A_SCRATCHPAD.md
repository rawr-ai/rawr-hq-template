# AGENT A Scratchpad

- [2026-02-20T18:40:09Z] Initialized scratchpad after writing verbatim plan. Next: collect required skill evidence and scope-anchor evidence with line numbers.
- [2026-02-20T18:40:22Z] Confirmed worktree branch \'codex/orpc-inngest-autonomy-assessment\'. Scope files present under docs/projects/orpc-ingest-workflows-spec including README, ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS, axes, implementation-adjacent spec, and examples.
- [2026-02-20T18:40:48Z] Completed required skill introspection with line anchors. Key rubric extracted: explicit axis positioning + mandate checks (solution/api/system/domain), single-authority boundaries (domain-design), contract-first and drift safeguards (orpc), step-boundary durability + side-effect constraints (inngest).
- [2026-02-20T18:43:18Z] Parsed README/ARCHITECTURE/DECISIONS + axes 01-12 + implementation-adjacent spec + examples. Initial contradictions spotted: (a) D-015 'verbatim' language in IMPLEMENTATION_ADJACENT_DOC_UPDATES_SPEC differs from DECISIONS lock text; (b) example host-mount order in E2E-02 and E2E-03 does not match D-008/ARCHITECTURE explicit order, while E2E-04 does align.
- [2026-02-20T18:46:24Z] Final analysis drafted in AGENT_A_FINAL_SPEC_PACKET_ANALYSIS.md with required sections and evidence-map schema. Primary integrity findings: D-008 example drift, D-015 verbatim/stale-sequencing mismatch, D-011 interpretation ambiguity.
