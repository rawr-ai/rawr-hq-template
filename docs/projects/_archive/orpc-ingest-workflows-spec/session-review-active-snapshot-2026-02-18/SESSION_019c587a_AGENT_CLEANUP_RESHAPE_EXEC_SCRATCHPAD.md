# SESSION_019c587a_AGENT_CLEANUP_RESHAPE_EXEC_SCRATCHPAD

## Drift Lock
- Cleanup only. No edits to policy content.
- No movement of official spec docs or reshape execution input docs.

## Working Notes
- Mandatory skills and corpus read-gates completed before any move operations.
- Archive action will use an explicit frozen candidate list (no wildcard destructive moves).
- Post-move verification must explicitly confirm:
  1. no official spec docs archived
  2. no reshape input docs archived
- Move execution completed: 24 items archived to `docs/projects/_archive/flat-runtime-session-review/session-artifacts/prework-reshape-cleanup-2026-02-18`.

## Output Checklist
- [x] `SESSION_019c587a_RESHAPE_PREWORK_ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.yaml`
- [x] `SESSION_019c587a_RESHAPE_PREWORK_ARCHIVE_REPORT.md`
- [x] Candidate list frozen before move
- [x] Safety gates verified after move
