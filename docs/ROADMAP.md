# ROADMAP

## Current Focus

- Harden `RAWR HQ-Template` governance and naming.
- Stabilize plugin channel separation.
- Improve downstream update guidance.

## Near-Term Milestones

1. Complete command-surface migration to `rawr hq plugins ...`.
2. Expand template docs and publishing rails.
3. Finalize upstream sync operating model.

## Later (Parked / Future)

- External workspace plugin source locking (`rawr.lock`) after external sources are introduced.
- Marketplace/library workflows beyond local-first baseline.
- LLM-judge security layer beyond deterministic checks.
