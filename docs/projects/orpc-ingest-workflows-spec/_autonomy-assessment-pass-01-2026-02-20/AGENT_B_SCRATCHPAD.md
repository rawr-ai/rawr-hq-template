# Agent B Scratchpad

- 2026-02-20T18:40:10Z Initialized scratchpad, plan file written, proceeding to skill introspection and packet/runtime evidence collection.
- 2026-02-20T18:40:30Z Verified worktree branch codex/orpc-inngest-autonomy-assessment and dirty state limited to artifact directory. Located packet target-state docs DECISIONS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.
- 2026-02-20T18:40:48Z Completed required skill introspection reads for solution-design, system-design, domain-design, typescript, orpc, and inngest. Extracted lenses: boundary authority, contract-first invariants, trust-boundary parsing, loop/second-order analysis, and durable step semantics.
- 2026-02-20T18:42:04Z Completed runtime anchor pass (apps/server + coordination/core/state packages + tests). Early deltas: runtime mounts `/api/inngest`, `/rpc`, `/api/orpc`, but no `/api/workflows/<capability>/*`; hq contract is package-owned (coordination/state) not plugin-owned boundary contracts; tests enforce RPC/OpenAPI and ingress existence, but no caller-path negative-route assertions for `/api/inngest` or `/rpc` external forbiddance.
- 2026-02-20T18:42:31Z Packet-vs-runtime checkpoint: DECISIONS D-005/D-006/D-007 require manifest-driven `/api/workflows/<capability>/*` + plugin-owned boundary contracts, but runtime anchor code currently composes package-owned contracts and mounts only `/api/inngest`, `/rpc`, `/api/orpc`. D-015 caller-path negative-route assertions not present in current server tests.
- 2026-02-20T18:43:59Z Wrote AGENT_B_FINAL_RUNTIME_DELTA_MAP.md with required sections (Skills Introspected, Evidence Map, Assumptions, Risks, Unresolved Questions) and a decision-indexed aligned/divergent/non-overlap matrix.
- 2026-02-20T18:44:14Z Removed one malformed scratchpad line generated by an escaped-command-substitution error to keep notes clean.
