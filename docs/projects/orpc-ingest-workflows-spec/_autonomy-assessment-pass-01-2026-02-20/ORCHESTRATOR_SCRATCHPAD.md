# ORCHESTRATOR SCRATCHPAD

## 2026-02-20T13:39:00-08:00
- Initialized branch/worktree execution.
- Wrote approved execution plan verbatim.
- Next: dispatch 6 specialists with strict artifact ownership and skill introspection requirements.

## 2026-02-20T13:54:00-08:00
- Collected all six agent final docs and verified required file presence.
- Confirmed runtime anchors directly for: route mounts, static context creation, metadata parsing, test coverage.
- Confirmed branch/worktree remain isolated at `codex/orpc-inngest-autonomy-assessment`.

- Arbitration decision: D-011 is split outcome:
  - schema placement = aligned,
  - request-context envelope enforcement = divergent.
- Arbitration decision: D-008 has two separate issues:
  - packet examples show local drift risk,
  - runtime bootstrap evidence for baseline traces ordering is incomplete/divergent in assessed anchors.
- Arbitration decision: overall solution judgment = conditional yes (target shape right, migration controls insufficient).

## 2026-02-20T14:06:00-08:00
- Wrote integrated outputs:
  - `INTEGRATED_ASSESSMENT.md`
  - `RISK_REGISTER.yaml`
  - `GAP_REGISTER.yaml`
  - `ALTERNATIVES_COMPARISON.md`
  - `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- Applied single evidence schema fields in integrated matrix and gap register:
  - `claim`, `proposal_source`, `runtime_source`, `alignment_status`, `impact`, `confidence`.
