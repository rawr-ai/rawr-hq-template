# Integrator Scratch

## Integration Notes
- Keep naming stable: `invoice-processing` across all examples.
- Ensure all docs point to `rawr.hq.ts` as sole composition authority.
- Close/open decisions explicitly in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Update legacy docs to avoid dual composition guidance.

## Outstanding Checks
- Verify runbook index includes manifest composition runbook.
- Verify ownership docs mention new plugin surfaces.
