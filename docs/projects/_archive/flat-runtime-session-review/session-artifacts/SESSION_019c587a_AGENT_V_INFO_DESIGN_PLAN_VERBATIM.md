Plan:
1. Confirm existing docs and instructions, including AGENTS and any relevant spec files, to understand current info-design context and required evaluations.
2. Read the full redesigned spec corpus, converged direction, and integration artifacts referenced by the session to gather mandatory context.
3. Evaluate docs against the eight gates listed in the prompt, noting any policy/structure issues and minimal safe fixes needed.
4. Draft the final info-design review report with gate pass/fail status, summaries, and touched files, using the required final artifact path.
