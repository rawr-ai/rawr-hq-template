# DOCS

This file is the documentation architecture contract for `RAWR HQ-Template`.

## Gateway Docs

Canonical gateway docs at `docs/` root:
- `PRODUCT.md`
- `SYSTEM.md`
- `PROCESS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `DOCS.md`

## Directory Roles

- `docs/product/`: product scope and user-facing semantics.
- `docs/system/`: architecture and technical contracts.
- `docs/process/`: workflows, contribution, and operating playbooks.
- `docs/projects/`: time-bound initiative docs.
- `docs/_templates/`: document scaffolds.
- `docs/_archive/`: archived historical docs not part of active template guidance.

## Canonicality Rules

- ALL-CAPS files are canonical at their scope.
- Prefer links to canonical docs over duplicating guidance.
- Time-bound execution notes belong in `docs/projects/` or `docs/_archive/`, not canonical docs.

## Naming Rules

Use these names consistently:
- Template repo: `RAWR HQ-Template`
- Personal repo: `RAWR HQ`
