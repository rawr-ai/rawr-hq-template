# SESSION_019c587a - Agent F Step 7 Plan

## Objective (Step 7 Only)
Finalize contradiction resolution and policy matrix ownership mapping so no duplicate/conflicting policy statements remain in the canonical doc.

## In Scope
1. Finalize policy matrix ownership clarity for:
   - domain package,
   - API plugin,
   - workflows plugin,
   - host app,
   - composition manifest.
2. Add/refresh explicit contradiction-removals list with currently resolved contradictions.
3. Remove duplicate/conflicting policy statements from canonical sections/examples.
4. Keep ORPC/Inngest/Elysia alignment intact without new architecture branches.

## Out of Scope
1. Step 8 cleanup deletions.
2. New policy domains unrelated to contradiction resolution/matrix clarity.
3. Implementation/code changes.

## Planned Edits
1. Update policy matrix header/rows to explicitly represent composition manifest ownership layer.
2. Remove duplicate policy criteria text from example sections where policy is already canonical above.
3. Tighten example section wording to reference policy rather than redefining it.
4. Expand contradiction-removals list with explicit replaced/removed conflicts from current canonical content.

## Step 7 Gate
No duplicate/conflicting policy statements remain, and the policy matrix provides clear owner/layer mapping across domain package, API plugin, workflows plugin, host app, and composition manifest.
