# Agent S Info-Design Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm branch/worktree state and respect existing in-flight edits by other agents.
2. Load and apply the `information-design` skill with `info:assess` intent.
3. Read the full required corpus, including packet posture, packet axes/examples, redesign/context packet, and both analysis/proposal tracks (A/B).
4. Capture structured notes continuously in the Agent S scratchpad:
   - invariants and policy boundaries (especially D-005..D-010)
   - conflicts, overlaps, and gaps across inputs
   - candidate convergence decisions and rejected alternatives
5. Synthesize a single converged direction optimized for a portable canonical spec surface (not an execution-plan format), with explicit sections for:
   - canonical authority model
   - role taxonomy
   - single-source ownership map
   - portable-linking rules
   - migration blueprint (current -> target)
   - unchanged architecture-policy boundaries
6. Validate that policy meaning is preserved (D-005..D-010), language is principal-level and clear, and machine-local absolute anchors are excluded from canonical guidance.
7. Write final output to `SESSION_019c587a_INFO_DESIGN_CONVERGED_DIRECTION.md` and provide a concise completion summary with top five converged directives.
