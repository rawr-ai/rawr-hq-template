- [2026-02-21 08:33:52 EST] Reviewed commit metadata and changed paths from `ca9c57b`.
- [2026-02-21 08:34:31 EST] Read current post-fix implementations and artifacts:
  - `scripts/phase-d/verify-d4-disposition.mjs`

- [2026-02-21 08:35:06 EST] Re-ran gate evidence:
  - `bun run phase-d:d4:assess` => pass; both D4 scan artifacts reported `(unchanged)`.
  - `bun run phase-d:gate:d4-disposition` => pass; `state=deferred` and `d3RecurrenceTriggered=false`.
  - `bun run phase-d:gate:d3-ingress-middleware-structural-contract` => pass.
- [2026-02-21 08:35:23 EST] Verified working tree remained clean after reruns.
- [2026-02-21 08:35:54 EST] Findings closure determination:
  - Prior Finding 1 (remediation-cycle evidence): partially closed; remediation cycle now modeled, but recurrence matcher accepts `phase-d:d3:quick/full` failures instead of only required `phase-d:gate:d3-ingress-middleware-structural-contract` failures.
  - Prior Finding 2 (heavy-chain depth): closed.
  - Prior Finding 3 (artifact churn): closed.
- [2026-02-21 08:36:12 EST] Introspected review lenses:
  - `/Users/mateicanavra/.codex-rawr/skills/typescript/SKILL.md`
  - `/Users/mateicanavra/.codex-rawr/skills/orpc/SKILL.md`
- [2026-02-21 08:36:20 EST] Final disposition selected: `approve_with_changes`.
