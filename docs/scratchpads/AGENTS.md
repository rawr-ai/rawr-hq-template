# Docs: scratchpads

- Ephemeral working notes; not a source of truth.
- Promote durable decisions into `docs/PLAN.md`, a plan doc, or a spike doc.
- Never put secrets here (assume these may be shared).

## Next
- `../AGENTS.md` — docs map + canonical docs
- `phase-2/` — Phase 2 working notes (owner-scoped)
