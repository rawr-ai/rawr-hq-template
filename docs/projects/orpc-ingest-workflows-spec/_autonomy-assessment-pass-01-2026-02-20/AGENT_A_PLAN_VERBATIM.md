# AGENT A Research Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm repository/worktree state and lock scope to the assigned artifact root.
2. Read and extract governing heuristics from required skills:
   - solution-design
   - system-design
   - domain-design
   - api-design
   - orpc
   - inngest
3. Read and index all scope anchors for decision integrity review:
   - README.md
   - ARCHITECTURE.md
   - DECISIONS.md
   - axes/*.md
   - IMPLEMENTATION_ADJACENT_DOC_UPDATES_SPEC.md
   - examples/*.md
4. Build a traceable evidence ledger with absolute file paths and line anchors for all substantive claims.
5. Assess D-005..D-015 on three dimensions:
   - Internal consistency across spec packet documents
   - Authority quality (normative source strength and cross-doc grounding)
   - Contradiction risk (explicit and latent conflicts, unresolved coupling)
6. Produce a structured Evidence Map table using schema:
   claim | proposal_source | runtime_source | alignment_status | impact | confidence
7. Document explicit assumptions, governance feasibility risks, and unresolved questions needed to close decision integrity gaps.
8. Write final analysis to AGENT_A_FINAL_SPEC_PACKET_ANALYSIS.md, citing skills and source evidence with absolute paths + anchors.
9. Validate output constraints:
   - only 3 assigned output files edited
   - required sections present
   - focus remains on decision quality, contradiction detection, and governance feasibility.
