# Phase E Planning Handoff

## Status
Phase E planning is ready for runtime implementation kickoff.

## Runtime Kickoff Order
1. E1 dedupe policy hardening.
2. E2 finished-hook policy hardening.
3. E3 structural evidence gates.
4. E4 decision closure.
5. E5 review/fix closure.
6. E5A structural assessment.
7. E6 docs/cleanup.
8. E7 Phase F readiness.

## Critical Controls
1. Keep route families unchanged.
2. Keep channel semantics as command surfaces only.
3. Keep evidence/disposition verification durable and cleanup-safe.
4. Enforce per-slice branch tracking and submit.
