# Axis Intro Template (Policy-Preserving)

Use this at the top of every axis immediately after the title.

## Axis Opening
- What this axis is: one sentence.
- What it covers: one sentence listing concern groups.
- What this communicates: one sentence stating the decision outcome readers should leave with.
- Who should read this: primary consumer roles.
- Jump conditions: where to go if the reader needs adjacent concerns.

## Canonical Policy Shape
When policy list length exceeds ~8 items, use grouped sections:
1. Core Invariants (must remember)
2. Operational Conventions (enforce/validate)
3. Verification / Negative Assertions
4. Optional Naming / Style Defaults (secondary)

## Optional Operational Blocks
- Surface model table
- Pattern snippets
- What changed vs unchanged
- Verification hooks

## Guardrails
1. Preserve policy meaning verbatim where possible.
2. Avoid introducing new obligations in structural rewrite passes.
3. Keep cross-axis links concise and decision-relevant.
