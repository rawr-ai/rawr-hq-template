# Agent 1 Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm repository/worktree state and capture initial context constraints for Phase D planning-only output.
2. Introspect mandatory skills and workflow prompts, extracting planning heuristics relevant to architecture slicing, dependency ordering, and milestone hardening.
3. Read the full required grounding corpus from Phase C runtime execution outputs and architecture axes.
4. Build an evidence ledger with absolute-path line anchors for all claims that influence Phase D ordering, boundaries, and conditional triggers.
5. Synthesize a decision-complete Phase D slice architecture and ordering sequence, including dependencies, owner boundaries, conditional D4 trigger criteria, and drift/failure triggers under a forward-only posture.
6. Record assumptions, risks, unresolved questions, and validation checkpoints needed for handoff into the planning packet.
7. Produce the final report at the required path with all mandated sections and verify completeness against the mission contract.
