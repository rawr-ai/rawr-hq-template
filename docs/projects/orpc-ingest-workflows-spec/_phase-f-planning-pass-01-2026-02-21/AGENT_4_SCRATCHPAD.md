## Worklog
1. Completed required skill introspection for team-design, information-design, architecture, decision-logging, graphite.
2. Loaded all required Phase F planning corpus documents with line-number anchors.
3. Cross-checked F4/D-004 semantics against locked decision register language.
4. Cross-checked execution entrypoint file ownership against implementation spec and acceptance gates.
5. Cross-checked review expectations against reusable phase execution workflow.

## Interim Findings
1. F4 trigger/status semantics are ambiguous for operational execution.
2. Canonical entrypoint and implementation spec diverge on touched-file inventory.
3. F5 review language under-specifies adversarial boundary-check expectations.

## Candidate Disposition
- changes-required
