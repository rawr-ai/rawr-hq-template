# ORPC + Inngest Spec Packet Decisions

## Scope
Packet-local decision tracking for documentation-architecture changes only.

## Current Status
No new packet-local architecture decisions were introduced in this breakout pass.

## Inherited Canonical Decision Sources
- `../SESSION_019c587a_ORPC_INNGEST_WORKFLOWS_POSTURE_SPEC.md`
- `../SESSION_019c587a_ORPC_INNGEST_WORKFLOWS_POSTURE_SPEC.md` locked decisions and global invariants

## Rule
If future packet edits reveal a new architecture-impacting ambiguity, add it here before continuing edits.
