# Docs: plans

- Execution plans (actionable, reviewable, intended to be followed).
- If code diverges from plan, update the plan (avoid silent drift).

## Next
- `PHASE_2_FACTORY.md` — factory direction + constraints
- `SECURITY_HARDENING_PLAN.md` — security roadmap (docs-only until implemented)
- `../PLAN.md` — architecture + execution runbook (canonical)
