# Agent B Research Plan (Verbatim)

1. Establish execution context in the assigned worktree and artifact root, then preserve strict output boundaries (only 3 assigned files).
2. Initialize a timestamped scratchpad and append notes continuously as evidence is collected.
3. Introspect required skills (`solution-design`, `system-design`, `domain-design`, `typescript`, `orpc`, `inngest`) and extract evaluation lenses relevant to runtime reality mapping.
4. Locate packet target-state decisions and convert them into an explicit decision checklist for alignment testing.
5. Inspect scope-anchor runtime files and contracts to map current ORPC/Inngest composition, invocation boundaries, and ownership seams.
6. Inspect tests for contract drift and runtime behavior assertions to validate implemented guarantees versus intended architecture.
7. Build an evidence table with absolute file paths and line anchors for every substantive claim.
8. Produce an aligned/divergent/non-overlap matrix against packet decisions with clear rationale and citations.
9. Document assumptions, risks, and unresolved questions that block deterministic convergence.
10. Write final artifact `AGENT_B_FINAL_RUNTIME_DELTA_MAP.md` with the required sections and concise recommendations for next investigation pass.
