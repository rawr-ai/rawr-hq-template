# Agent 3 Scratch: Implementation Structure

## Verified facts

- Channel A requires oclif manifest and command discovery from built path.
- Channel B requires runtime exports and explicit enablement state behavior.
- Example plugins in repo validate both channels.

## Unsure/needs re-verify

- Whether any additional optional runtime interfaces should be standardized now.

## Open questions captured

- Single package strategy for dual-mode plugins vs split packages in future.

## Output contributed

- Channel-specific package skeleton guidance.
- Contract and failure-mode mapping.
