# Agent 1 Plan Verbatim (Fallback Execution)

## Role
P1 architecture and slice ordering for Phase E.

## Plan
1. Re-ground on canonical packet, Phase D readiness, and Phase E prep note.
2. Confirm immutable invariants and non-goals.
3. Produce slice order with dependencies, failure triggers, and owner roles.
4. Encode D-009/D-010 evidence-close criteria with explicit closure/defer paths.
5. Emit execution-ready architecture/ordering document with references.
