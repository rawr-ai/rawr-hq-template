# Agent 1 Research Plan (Verbatim)

1. Use `information-design` `/info:assess` workflow as the primary method: assess reader/task/navigation assumptions, diagnose structural defaults, and test hierarchy/scent/scanability.
2. Maintain a timestamped scratchpad continuously throughout the pass, recording what was read, what evidence was captured, and why each finding matters.
3. Read the full packet in scope with complete coverage:
   - root packet docs (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CANONICAL_EXPANSION_NAV.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_ADJACENT_DOC_UPDATES_SPEC.md`)
   - every axis under `axes/`
4. Evaluate packet-level information design first (entry flow, wayfinding, cross-doc coherence), then axis-level quality.
5. Perform axis-by-axis assessment focused on:
   - clarity of intent
   - hierarchy quality
   - information scent
   - scanability under long policy sections
   - presence/absence of concise intro framing (`what this axis is`, `what it covers`, `what it communicates`)
6. Use Axis 12 as a positive reference pattern and compare other axes against it (surface-based grouping, patterning, tabular digestibility).
7. Produce severity-ordered findings, then organize within severity by axis for execution clarity.
8. For each finding, provide:
   - absolute path + line anchors
   - problem statement
   - impact on reader comprehension/decision speed
   - concrete near-term rewrite strategy (no content rewrites in this pass)
9. Deliver a pragmatic final assessment report containing all required sections, including a reusable structural axis template and priority-ordered change set.
