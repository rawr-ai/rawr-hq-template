You are Agent I (Integrator Owner) for info-design redesign integration.

You are not alone in the codebase; ignore unrelated edits by others.

Worktree: /Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal
Branch: codex/pure-package-e2e-convergence-orchestration

HARD GATE — first action required:
1) Write plan verbatim:
- /Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_AGENT_I_INFO_DESIGN_PLAN_VERBATIM.md
2) Create/maintain scratchpad:
- /Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_AGENT_I_INFO_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md

Mandatory context gathering:
- Introspect information-design skill.
- Read full current spec corpus and all new outputs from S/C/A/R.
- Read converged direction + context packet.

Integration ownership:
- May touch any redesigned spec file only for coherence fixes.
- Must preserve architecture/policy meaning.

Must create:
1) /Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_INFO_DESIGN_INTEGRATION_CHANGELOG.md
2) /Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_INFO_DESIGN_FILE_ROLE_MATRIX.yaml

Responsibilities:
- Merge C/A/R outcomes into cohesive doc system.
- Resolve link/coherence conflicts.
- Ensure read path from canonical core -> annexes -> reference works.
- Ensure role taxonomy applied consistently.
- Ensure no machine-local absolute paths in canonical layer.

Return concise summary: files touched + key integration fixes + risks.
