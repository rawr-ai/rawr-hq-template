# Agent E Plan (Verbatim)

## Role
Agent E (Contraction/Integration Owner): integrate outputs from Agents A/B/C/T/D into one coherent canonical packet with no policy drift.

## Objective
1. Build integration matrix: source change, target file, policy impact, drift risk, merge decision.
2. Reconcile overlaps/conflicts in order:
   1. Decision register integrity
   2. Architecture invariants
   3. Axis consistency
   4. Example coherence
   5. Navigation/read-path clarity
3. Apply minimal safe edits required for coherence.
4. Produce final contraction report.

## Guardrails
- Preserve D-005..D-012 semantics.
- Integrate D-013/D-014/D-015 consistently.
- No runtime code edits.
- Do not edit process/runbook/testing docs outside this packet.
- Ignore unrelated edits; do not revert external work.

## Execution Plan
1. Intake and corpus verification
   - Confirm required skill intake and packet/scratchpad reads.
   - Map changed + new files in packet.
2. Integration analysis
   - Build candidate matrix from A/B/C/T/D contributions.
   - Detect collisions and ordering-sensitive drift points.
3. Contraction edits
   - Resolve decision/invariant/axis/example/navigation inconsistencies with minimal patches.
4. Drift validation
   - Run D-005..D-015 drift checks across README/ARCHITECTURE/DECISIONS/axes/examples.
5. Reporting
   - Finalize integration matrix + merged/rejected/deferred list.
   - Publish readiness statement for implementation-planning phase.
