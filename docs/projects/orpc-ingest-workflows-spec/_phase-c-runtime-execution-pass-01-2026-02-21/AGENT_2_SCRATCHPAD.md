# Agent 2 Scratchpad (C2)

- [2026-02-21 04:33:37 -0500] Initialized scratchpad and plan artifacts.
- [2026-02-21 04:34:06 -0500] Verified branch/worktree state (codex/phase-c-c2-telemetry-contract-expansion) and Graphite status context.
- [2026-02-21 04:34:36 -0500] Grounding path check: requested phase-b worktree docs missing; located equivalent docs in phase-c runtime/planning worktrees.
- [2026-02-21 04:35:19 -0500] Completed grounding read: phase workflow + architecture/decisions + phase C execution/spec/gates; captured C2 constraints (required telemetry hard-fail, no route-family drift).
- [2026-02-21 04:41:50 -0500] Implemented C2 changes: observability contract expansion, phase-c telemetry verifier, phase-a telemetry hard-fail scaffold, package script wiring, new C2 runtime tests.
- [2026-02-21 04:49:40 -0500] Verified green gates: `bun run phase-c:c2:quick` and `bun run phase-c:c2:full`.
- [2026-02-21 04:51:10 -0500] Final report written: `AGENT_2_FINAL_C2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
