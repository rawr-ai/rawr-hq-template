# Agent 2 Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm branch/worktree context and enforce planning-doc-only scope for this pass.
2. Complete mandatory skill introspection (solution-design, system-design, domain-design, api-design, typescript, orpc, inngest) and capture line-anchored notes.
3. Read the full required Phase C grounding corpus with line anchors before making any interface/type conclusions.
4. Inspect current repository implementation surfaces (contracts, middleware, adapter/runtime files, scripts, tests, package scripts) to build an exact Phase D touched-path and gate-wiring blueprint.
5. Produce D1-D3 interface/type delta proposals and conditional D4 delta proposals, explicitly preserving locked route topology and manifest/runtime invariants.
6. Build a non-overlap ownership/file map plus deferred/not-in-scope inventory to prevent slice collision and architecture drift.
7. Write final report with required sections (Skills Introspected, Evidence Map with absolute paths + line anchors, Assumptions, Risks, Unresolved Questions).
8. Commit docs-only changes and verify clean working state.
