# Axis 05: Simplicity and Legacy Removal (Legacy)

> **Authority note:** Canonical ORPC/Inngest posture guidance lives in `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_ORPC_INNGEST_WORKFLOWS_POSTURE_SPEC.md` and `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/orpc-ingest-spec-packet/ORPC_INGEST_SPEC_PACKET.md`. The simplicity and legacy-removal reasoning formerly hosted here has been moved verbatim to `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/additive-extractions/LEGACY_METADATA_REMOVAL.md` so implementers can still consult it without conflicting with the authoritative packet.
