Plan for D-005 Integration Execution
1. Surface where the D-005 recommendation (manifest-driven workflow surfaces, capability-first `/api/workflows/*`, workflow context, and Inngest bundle wiring) needs to live in the canonical packet: DECISIONS, the posture spec, and the relevant axis documents (composition, workflows, etc.).
2. Update the spec text so D-005's new host spine is described where platform engineers look: include the `/api/workflows` path wiring, `rawr.hq.ts` manifest shape, workflow context separation, and re-asserted /api/inngest runtime-only rule within the axis docs.
3. Lock the decision in `DECISIONS.md` with a concise resolution and note downstream docs updated; ensure any open adjacent items (D-006, D-008/009/010) remain explicit.
4. Confirm the packet overview (`SESSION_019c587a_ORPC_INNGEST_WORKFLOWS_POSTURE_SPEC.md`) and packet index (`ORPC_INGEST_SPEC_PACKET.md`) mention the new D-005 posture so readers understand where to find the implementation guidance.
5. Keep the scratchpad up to date with skills/context/steps and leave an unresolved items list at the end for future passes.
