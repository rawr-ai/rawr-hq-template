# D6 Cleanup Manifest

## Scope
Cleanup executed for Phase D runtime pass artifacts after D1..D5A closure work. This pass removes superseded scratch/intermediate artifacts and keeps closure-critical records for D7 integration.

## Deleted (superseded scratch/intermediate)
Superseded runtime-pass working artifacts were pruned post-closure. Use `docs/projects/orpc-ingest-workflows-spec/HISTORY_RECOVERY.md` for deterministic recovery from git history.

## Retained (closure-critical)
1. `D4_DISPOSITION.md`
2. `D4_DEDUPE_SCAN_RESULT.json`
3. `D4_FINISHED_HOOK_SCAN_RESULT.json`
4. `D5_REVIEW_DISPOSITION.md`
5. `D5A_STRUCTURAL_DISPOSITION.md`
6. `D6_CLEANUP_MANIFEST.md`
7. `D7_PHASE_E_READINESS.md`
8. `PHASE_D_EXECUTION_REPORT.md`
9. `FINAL_PHASE_D_HANDOFF.md`

## Canonical Docs Updated in D6
1. `README.md` (added Phase D packet/runtime artifact routing)
2. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (updated Phase D runtime status and closure pointers)
