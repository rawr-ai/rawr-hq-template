# RAWR — Local-first AI HQ (Template)

This repo is the **RAWR v1 template**: a local-first, Bun + TypeScript monorepo where the primary interface is an **oclif CLI** (`rawr`).

**Why `rawr-hq`?** The GitHub org already has `RAWR-AI/rawr`. This repo is intended to **take over as `rawr`** once we’re ready to cut over. See `docs/FUTURE_RENAME.md`.

## Quickstart

```bash
bun install
bun run test
```

## Plan

See `docs/PLAN.md` (single source of truth).
