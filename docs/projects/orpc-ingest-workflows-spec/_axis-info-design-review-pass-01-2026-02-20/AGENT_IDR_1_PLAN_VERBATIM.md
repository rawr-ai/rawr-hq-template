# AGENT IDR-1 Plan (Verbatim)

1. Establish protocol artifacts in strict order: create this plan file, then initialize and continuously maintain a timestamped scratchpad.
2. Introspect the required skills to align audit method and terminology:
   - information-design
   - solution-design
   - system-design
   - domain-design
   - api-design
   - docs-architecture
3. Read the full required packet (all named root docs, all `axes/*.md`, all `examples/*.md`) with line-aware notes for evidence anchoring.
4. Perform an information-design audit focused on:
   - policy clarity,
   - axis standalone comprehensibility,
   - cognitive load from long canonical policy lists,
   - need for concise intro framing per axis,
   - concrete structural improvements using Axis 12 as benchmark style.
5. Produce severity-ordered findings with file+line anchors, problem statements, impact rationale, and concrete rewrite strategy.
6. Build an axis-by-axis scorecard for clarity, navigability, policy digestibility, and intro quality.
7. Define a reusable “Axis Introduction Pattern” and prioritize where to apply it first.
8. Deliver final report at the required path with required sections:
   - Skills Introspected
   - Evidence Map
   - Assumptions
   - Risks
   - Unresolved Questions
9. Restrict edits to assigned artifact files only and ignore unrelated repository changes.
