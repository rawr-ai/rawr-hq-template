# Phase F Planning Review Disposition

## Disposition
`approve`

## Notes
1. P1/P2/P3 parallel planning outputs were integrated into one packet.
2. P4 steward review was completed and escalated one blocking + one high planning finding; both were fixed in this branch.
3. Packet/spec/gates are aligned on F-slice ownership and F4 trigger/disposition semantics.
4. Runtime kickoff is approved under locked invariants.

## Open Items (Non-Blocking)
1. None.
