# Archive Note: D005-D007 Closure Inputs

This folder contains superseded session-era synthesis and migration notes that were used to converge workflow routing, boundary ownership, and caller/client semantics.

Canonical source now lives in the packet docs under:
- `docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/orpc-ingest-spec-packet/`
- `docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/SESSION_019c587a_ORPC_INNGEST_WORKFLOWS_POSTURE_SPEC.md`

These archived files are retained for historical traceability only and should not be treated as current canonical policy.
