# AGENT 2 Research Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm worktree/branch context and limit activity to review-only deliverables.
2. Initialize and continuously update a timestamped scratchpad for all review observations and checkpoints.
3. Introspect required skills before substantive packet review:
   - information-design
   - solution-design
   - system-design
   - domain-design
   - api-design
   - team-design
   - orpc
   - inngest
   - docs-architecture
4. Read the claimed Agent 1 changed files in full:
   - axes/13-distribution-and-instance-lifecycle-model.md
   - DECISIONS.md
   - ARCHITECTURE.md
   - README.md
   - CANONICAL_EXPANSION_NAV.md
5. Perform whole-packet coherence checks against canonical packet authority and adjacent axes/examples where needed.
6. Validate scope discipline:
   - bake-now changes remain policy/seam level,
   - deferred items are explicit, centralized, and non-contradictory,
   - no regressions against D-005..D-015.
7. Record findings ordered by severity with concrete file/line evidence, impact rationale, and fix recommendations.
8. Produce AGENT_2_REVIEW_REPORT.md with required sections:
   - Skills Introspected
   - Evidence Map
   - Assumptions
   - Risks
   - Unresolved Questions
   - explicit conclusion (approve / approve_with_changes / not_ready)
9. Verify deliverables exist at artifact root and summarize outcome without proposing implementation plans.
