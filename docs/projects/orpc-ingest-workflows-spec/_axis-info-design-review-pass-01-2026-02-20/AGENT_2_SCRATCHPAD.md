# Agent 2 Scratchpad

- [2026-02-20 15:22:47 -0500] Initialized scratchpad.
- [2026-02-20 15:22:47 -0500] Introspected information-design skill at /Users/mateicanavra/.codex-rawr/skills/information-design/SKILL.md before substantive analysis.
- [2026-02-20 15:22:47 -0500] Wrote verbatim plan to AGENT_2_PLAN_VERBATIM.md.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:10 -0500] Enumerated markdown docs under packet root. Counts: top-level=6, axes=13, examples=4, plus historical underscore-prefixed pass artifacts.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:10 -0500] Assessment scope set to canonical packet docs (top-level + axes + examples), excluding underscore-prefixed pass artifact directories as non-canonical execution artifacts.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:36 -0500] Computed line counts for canonical packet docs (top-level + axes + examples). Largest files are examples/e2e-04-context-middleware.md (1206 lines) and examples/e2e-02/e2e-03 (~677/679 lines).
- [2026-02-20 15:23:54 -0500] Completed full read with line anchors: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:54 -0500] Early signal: ARCHITECTURE has strong authority framing but high list-density (40-item invariants + 31-item defaults) that may exceed scan budget without grouping.
- [2026-02-20 15:24:22 -0500] Completed full read with anchors: axes 01-08.
- [2026-02-20 15:24:22 -0500] Pattern observed: axes 01-08 share core scaffolding (core reference/in-scope/out-of-scope/canonical policy/why/trade-offs) but policy sections are often long flat lists with mixed concern levels.
- [2026-02-20 15:25:19 -0500] Completed full read with anchors: examples e2e-01 through e2e-04 (chunked).
- [2026-02-20 15:25:19 -0500] Example docs are highly detailed and policy-aligned but include repeated checklist/policy blocks that blur reference-example boundaries and raise navigation load.
- [2026-02-20 15:26:32 -0500] Extracted structural metrics: policy-list lengths by axis and heading consistency (Why/Trade-Offs present only on subset; longest policy lists on axes 02/06/07/08/12).
- [2026-02-20 15:26:32 -0500] Starting synthesis for severity-ranked findings, cross-packet navigation assessment, and axis-template proposal.
- [2026-02-20 15:27:51 -0500] Wrote final assessment report to AGENT_2_FINAL_INFO_DESIGN_ASSESSMENT.md with required sections, severity-ranked findings, mandatory/optional labels, and evidence anchors.
