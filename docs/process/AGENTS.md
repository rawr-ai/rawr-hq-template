# Docs: process

- Contribution/process docs (how we work), not “what we build”.
- Keep workflow invariants here (especially Graphite usage).
- Prefer updating existing process docs over adding near-duplicates.

## Next
- `GRAPHITE.md` — Graphite workflow invariants + quick commands
- `../PLAN.md` — architecture + runbook (canonical)
