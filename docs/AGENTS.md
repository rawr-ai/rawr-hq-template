# Docs

- Canonical home for architecture, security posture, and workflow/process docs (avoid duplicating “truth” elsewhere).
- If implementation diverges, update `docs/PLAN.md` (prevent silent drift).
- “Parked” items (e.g. marketplace, LLM judge) are doc-only until explicitly un-parked.

## Next
- `PLAN.md` — architecture + execution runbook (canonical)
- `SECURITY_MODEL.md` — security posture + gate boundary (canonical)
- `process/AGENTS.md` — contribution/workflow docs (Graphite, etc.)
- `plans/AGENTS.md` — executable plans
- `spikes/AGENTS.md` — investigations (may be parked)
- `scratchpads/AGENTS.md` — ephemeral notes (non-canonical)
- `FUTURE_RENAME.md` / `FUTURE_MARKETPLACE.md` — explicitly parked future topics
