# _archive/

Archived historical docs kept for context, not active canonical guidance.

## Command-Surface Warning

Archived docs may contain superseded command references.

- Canonical Channel A (oclif external plugins): `rawr plugins ...`
- Canonical Channel B (workspace runtime plugins): `rawr hq plugins ...`

If an archived doc disagrees with current command surfaces, treat the archived text as historical only and follow:
- `docs/PROCESS.md`
- `docs/system/PLUGINS.md`
