# Reflect Triggers And Timing

Use this timing model for reflection.

## Mid-work reflection (allowed)

Reflect during work when:
- repeated step patterns emerge
- a trap repeats
- a workflow invariant becomes clear

Keep mid-work reflections short and provisional.

## Strong trigger: end of a successful workflow

Always reflect after a clearly concluded multi-step workflow, especially when:
- objectives were complete
- multiple tasks/plans were involved
- coordination/handoff decisions mattered

## End-of-workflow checklist

1. Gather snippet evidence (`tail/search/show`).
2. Register workflow shape:
   - step sequence
   - key transitions
   - success criteria used
3. Capture invariants:
   - what stayed true and why it mattered
4. Capture traps:
   - what caused friction
   - what avoided/mitigated it
5. Split output:
   - canonical/generalizable insight
   - temporal/specific details to discard

## Output quality rule

A reflection is complete only if it distinguishes:
- reusable process guidance
- non-reusable contextual noise
