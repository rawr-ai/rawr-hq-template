# SESSION_019c587a Package Approaches - Mediator Scratchpad

## Objective
Produce two opposing architecture proposals for package role/contract ownership, each with full end-to-end examples, then synthesize compare/contrast.

## Worktree + Branch
- Worktree: `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal`
- Branch: `docs/flat-runtime-proposal`

## Deliverables
1. `SESSION_019c587a_PACKAGE_APPROACH_A_PURE_DOMAIN_E2E.md`
2. `SESSION_019c587a_PACKAGE_APPROACH_B_BOUNDARY_OR_RUNTIME_CENTRIC_E2E.md`
3. `SESSION_019c587a_PACKAGE_APPROACHES_COMPARE_CONTRAST_SCRATCH.md`

## Agent Workflow Contract
- Upfront introspection of required stack and repo skills.
- Plan doc first.
- Live scratchpad during research/composition.
- Final document with end-to-end concrete examples.
- Cross-critique phase: each agent critiques the other proposal and updates own rationale.

## Notes
- Preserve user uncertainty: existing AXIS_03 may overlap one side; still produce both fully worked docs for side-by-side comparison.
- Prioritize operational clarity: file layout, contract placement, example code paths, implications.

## Execution Log Update (Two-Agent Compare Run)
- Launched Agent A (`019c6807-32b5-7b62-887a-c4bd803ff9e9`) for pure-domain package approach.
- Launched Agent B (`019c6807-71c0-7180-8f39-cb9ea251ff01`) for contrasting boundary/runtime-centric package approach.
- Both agents created plan-first and maintained scratchpads before final docs.
- User clarification about schema/contract layering was forwarded; corrected scope so only relevant side treated it as a hard requirement.
- Both end-to-end docs were produced.
- Cross-critique exchange completed and both docs now include counter-review sections.
- Compare/contrast synthesis written to:
