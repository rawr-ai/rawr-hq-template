# Phase F Planning Handoff

## Status
Phase F planning is approved for runtime implementation kickoff.

## Runtime Kickoff Order
1. F1 runtime lifecycle seam hardening.
2. F2 interface/policy hardening.
3. F3 structural evidence gates.
4. F4 conditional D-004 disposition closure.
5. F5 independent review/fix closure.
6. F5A structural assessment.
7. F6 docs/cleanup.
8. F7 readiness + final handoff.

## Critical Controls
1. Keep route families unchanged.
2. Keep command surfaces separated from runtime metadata semantics.
3. Keep evidence/disposition verification durable and cleanup-safe.
4. Enforce per-slice branch tracking and submit.
5. Keep F4 trigger/disposition semantics tied to measurable scan counters and explicit D-004 status behavior.
