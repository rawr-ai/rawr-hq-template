# Agent 3 Plan Verbatim (Fallback Execution)

## Role
P3 verification and gates design for Phase E.

## Plan
1. Derive quick/full gate chains per E1-E4 and closure slices.
2. Ensure cleanup-safe evidence/disposition verification.
3. Define phase-exit contract and negative assertions.
4. Publish acceptance gates and gate ownership map.
