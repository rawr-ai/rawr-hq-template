# Agent 3 Plan (Verbatim)

1. Confirm branch/worktree context and preserve docs-only planning scope for this pass.
2. Perform mandatory skill introspection (solution-design, system-design, api-design, typescript, orpc, inngest, docs-architecture) before substantive conclusions.
3. Read the full required grounding corpus and collect line-anchored evidence for Phase D verification constraints and invariants.
4. Inspect current repo gate wiring (`package.json` scripts, `scripts/phase-a`, `scripts/phase-c`, server/core/runtime tests) to map baseline quick/full cadence and anti-drift assertions.
5. Design Phase D gate matrix for D1-D3 plus conditional D4 assess/disposition, including exact command contract blueprint.
6. Define independent review/fix re-review loop, structural assessment gate criteria, and phase exit contract with forward-only controls.
7. Produce final report with required sections (Skills Introspected, Evidence Map with absolute paths + line anchors, Assumptions, Risks, Unresolved Questions).
8. Commit docs-only deliverables and verify clean status.
