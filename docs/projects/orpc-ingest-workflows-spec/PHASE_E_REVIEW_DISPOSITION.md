# Phase E Planning Review Disposition

## Disposition
`approve`

## Notes
1. Planning packet is decision-complete for execution kickoff.
2. D-009/D-010 closure path is explicit and evidence-driven.
3. Route-family and runtime identity invariants remain fixed.
4. Review/fix, structural quality, docs/cleanup, and readiness remain mandatory closure gates.

## Open Items (Non-Blocking)
1. None at planning level.
