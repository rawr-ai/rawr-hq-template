# Agent 1 Scratchpad

- [2026-02-20 15:22:40 EST] Initialized scratchpad after writing AGENT_1_PLAN_VERBATIM.md.
- [2026-02-20 15:22:40 EST] Method locked: information-design /info:assess workflow (hierarchy-as-meaning, scent-over-labels, skim-test, noise-test).
- [2026-02-20 15:22:55 EST] Reading scope confirmed: root packet docs, all 13 axis docs, and 4 examples docs.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:15 EST] Completed full read of root packet docs (README, ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS, CANONICAL_EXPANSION_NAV, IMPLEMENTATION_ADJACENT_DOC_UPDATES_SPEC, PROJECT_STATUS).
- [2026-02-20 15:23:15 EST] Early signal: ARCHITECTURE has very long flat policy enumerations (40-item invariants; 31-item defaults) and duplicated route/navigation sections, increasing scan burden.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:15 EST] Early signal: implementation-adjacent spec uses many long directive blocks with low visual hierarchy between must/should/how-to-execute.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:28 EST] Completed full read of axes 01-04.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:28 EST] Observed repeated preamble boilerplate across axes (canonical reference + scope blocks), improving consistency but adding vertical overhead before axis-specific value.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:28 EST] Axis 02 canonical policy list (20 items) and naming defaults list (8 items) are clear but could benefit from grouped sub-head labels by concern.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:43 EST] Completed full read of axes 05-08.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:43 EST] Axis 07/08 have high policy-value content but low policy chunking density; long lists mix route policy, ownership, composition, naming, and D-014 seam notes in single runs.
- [2026-02-20 15:23:43 EST] Axis 08 has strong practical examples but late-arriving orientation; intro framing could better prime the reader before the 23-point policy block.
- [2026-02-20 15:24:31 EST] Completed full read of all four examples docs (E2E 01-04) using full line-range coverage.
- [2026-02-20 15:24:31 EST] Example docs are strong on orientation scaffolding; however, they are significantly more scannable than many axis docs, creating packet-style inconsistency.
- [2026-02-20 15:24:31 EST] Axis 12 remains strongest policy-reference style baseline: concise framing + layered tables + explicit purpose boundaries + mandatory negative tests.
- [2026-02-20 15:25:20 EST] Extracted cross-axis metrics: longest Canonical Policy lists are Axis 08 (23), Axis 02 (20), Axis 07 (17), Axis 06/12 (15).
- [2026-02-20 15:25:20 EST] Drafting core findings around: (1) ungrouped long policy lists, (2) missing concise axis-intent intros, (3) repeated boilerplate before axis-specific value, (4) packet-level duplication of long normative lists.
- [2026-02-20 15:26:50 EST] Wrote final report to AGENT_1_FINAL_INFO_DESIGN_ASSESSMENT.md with required sections, severity-ranked findings, scorecard, template pattern, priority change set, and evidence map.
- [2026-02-20 15:27:21 EST] Verified final report section compliance against required headings (skills, method, findings, scorecard, template, priority set, evidence map, assumptions, risks, unresolved questions).
