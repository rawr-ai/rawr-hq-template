# PRODUCT

`RAWR HQ-Template` is a reusable template for building local-first AI headquarters with a single CLI (`rawr`) and extensible plugin channels.

## Product Roles

- `RAWR HQ-Template`: shared upstream baseline.
- `RAWR HQ`: user-owned downstream repo derived from the template.

## Non-Goals

- Embedding personal one-off workflows in the template baseline.
- Treating downstream repos as strict forks that must stay closely aligned.

## User Outcomes

- Start from template quickly.
- Build and run plugins locally.
- Optionally publish/install plugins through connected workflows.
- Pull upstream improvements when desired.
