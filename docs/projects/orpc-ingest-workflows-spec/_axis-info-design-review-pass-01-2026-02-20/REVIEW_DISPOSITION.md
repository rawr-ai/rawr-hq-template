# Review Disposition (Info-Design Assess Pass 01)

## Inputs
1. `AGENT_1_FINAL_INFO_DESIGN_ASSESSMENT.md`
2. `AGENT_2_FINAL_INFO_DESIGN_ASSESSMENT.md`

## Accepted Findings
1. Flat long policy lists are the main clarity risk.
2. Axis 12 pattern quality should be generalized.
3. Add explicit axis-level intro framing across packet.
4. Clarify authority boundaries for examples.
5. Reduce cross-document navigation duplication.

## Deferred / Not in Scope
1. Policy-semantic rewrites.
2. Architectural decision changes.
3. Runtime implementation changes.

## Orchestrator Decision
Approved for next step: execute a bounded information-design rewrite pass against packet docs only.
