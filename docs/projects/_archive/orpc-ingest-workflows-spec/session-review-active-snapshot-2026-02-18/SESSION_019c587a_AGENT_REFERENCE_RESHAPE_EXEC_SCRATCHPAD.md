# SESSION_019c587a_AGENT_REFERENCE_RESHAPE_EXEC_SCRATCHPAD

## Working Notes
- Scope locked to reference/examples outputs in `docs/projects/flat-runtime/`.
- Preserve code snippets and run-path clarity from legacy E2E docs.
- Apply reshape-plan clarity improvements only (bridge notes, diff-view trees, axes-covered wayfinding).

## Rename Choice
- Use `e2e-02-api-workflows-composed.md` (aligned with `RESHAPE_PROPOSAL.md` target structure and file-disposition table).
- Risk note to report: there is historical naming variance (`...-api-workflows.md` in one subordinate plan).

## Drift Guards
- No new route policy assertions.
- No new decision IDs or policy ownership changes.
- Keep caller/auth semantics descriptive and cross-reference canonical authority.
- Keep implementation code blocks intact except non-semantic surrounding prose/section framing.
