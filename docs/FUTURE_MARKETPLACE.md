# FUTURE: Marketplace / Library (Parked)

This concept is parked and out of current template scope.

If enabled later, marketplace workflows should build on the current architecture split:
- `RAWR HQ-Template` as canonical core upstream
- `RAWR HQ` repos as customized downstreams

Current baseline remains local-first, with connected workflows as opt-in.
