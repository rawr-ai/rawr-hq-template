# Future rename: `rawr-hq` → `rawr`

This repo exists as `rawr-hq` because `RAWR-AI/rawr` already exists.

**Intent:** once this template is ready, we will cut over so the canonical template repo becomes `RAWR-AI/rawr`.

## Cutover sketch (later)

- Create a tracking issue: “Rename rawr-hq to rawr”
- Decide approach:
  - Archive or rename the existing `RAWR-AI/rawr` repo
  - Rename `RAWR-AI/rawr-hq` to `RAWR-AI/rawr`
- Update:
  - Badges/links in README
  - Any docs that reference the old name
  - Graphite repo config if it is name-sensitive
