Plan for Decision Closure Recommendations
1. Document state: confirm open/proposed decisions in DECISIONS.md and refresh on axis docs/examples (already aligned with instructions).
2. Correlate existing code anchors (apps/server entrypoints, packages/core/orpc, coordination-inngest adapter/index) to each decision so recommendations cite real runtime behavior.
3. Draft decision-by-decision guidance: define load-bearing impact, recommend direction, enumerate alternatives, illustrate code/dom structure per decision, and classify blockers.
4. Outline lock order, post-lock documentation updates, and any outstanding questions needing user input.
5. Populate scratchpad and final recommendation files per deliverable requirements, ensuring final doc meets format (sections A–E) and includes guardrail/risk analysis.
