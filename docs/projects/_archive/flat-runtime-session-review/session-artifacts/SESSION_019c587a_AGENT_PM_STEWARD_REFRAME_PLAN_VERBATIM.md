# Plan
1. Anchor on the current canonical authority (posture spec + spec packet + axis docs) and note the locked decisions/ invariants relevant to the ORPC+Inngest subsystem.
2. Summarize the origin story via the loop-closure bridge, alignment matrix, and legacy extras so the PM narrative explains where we started and how the packet evolved.
3. Enumerate the policy cohesion boundary (what stays in this project vs what is kept as legacy/governance) using the axis docs, examples, and additive extractions.
4. Map the remaining completion work by enumerating the open/proposed decisions from the DECISIONS register and the runtime convergence gaps cited in loop closure.
5. Capture additional axis/docs needs by referencing legacy testing/simplification docs and noting ownership/boundaries for those governance strands.
6. Draft the final reframing artifacts (scratchpad plus PM+Steward project definition) using the above context and the requested template (project definition with functional context, origin link, spec map, new name, out-of-scope list, and candidate follow-ons).
