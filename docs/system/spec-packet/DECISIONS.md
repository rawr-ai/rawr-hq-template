# Flat Runtime Spec Packet Decisions

> **Authority note:** Decision tracking moved to `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/orpc-ingest-spec-packet/DECISIONS.md`. This file now serves as an archival pointer; only legacy deferred items remain in `/Users/mateicanavra/Documents/.nosync/DEV/rawr-hq-template-wt-flat-runtime-proposal/docs/projects/flat-runtime-session-review/additive-extractions/LEGACY_DECISIONS_APPENDIX.md`.

Previously resolved decisions (D-001 through D-003) are recorded in the canonical register above. For implementation clarity, consult that file and its parent posture spec for the current locked-in authority.

## Legacy deferred decisions
- `D-004 — Workflow-backed ORPC helper abstraction` (deferred) and `D-005 — publish tier metadata cleanup` remain in the legacy appendix so their triggers/owners stay visible while the authoritative register stays current.
