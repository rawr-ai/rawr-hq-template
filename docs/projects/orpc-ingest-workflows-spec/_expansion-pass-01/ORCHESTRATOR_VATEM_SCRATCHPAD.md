# ORCHESTRATOR VATEM Scratchpad

## Drift Lock
- Clarity + expansion of canonical spec only.
- No runtime code changes.
- Preserve D-005..D-012 semantics unless explicitly extending with D-013..D-015.
- Do not update process/runbook/testing docs in this pass; capture exact future updates in canonical packet.

## VATEM Progress
- V (Validate constraints): in progress
- A (Anchor context): completed on canonical + archive additive extraction docs
- T (Task partition): in progress
- E (Execute by ownership): pending
- M (Merge with no-drift gates): pending

## Active Paths
- Canonical root: docs/projects/orpc-ingest-workflows-spec/
- Expansion workspace: docs/projects/orpc-ingest-workflows-spec/_expansion-pass-01/
- Archive references: docs/projects/_archive/orpc-ingest-workflows-spec/session-artifacts/prework-reshape-cleanup-2026-02-18/additive-extractions/

## Mid-Run Adjustment
- Added dedicated Agent T (Testing Harness Spec Owner) per user lock.
- Agent T owns canonical testing harness specification and future-update doc contract.
